# AI4PH Summer Institute 2025: Synthetic Data Workshop
This repository contains materials for our workshop at the AI4PH Summer Institute 2025.

Session Objectives:

* Generating synthetic data using different generators
* Evaluating synthetic data in terms of fidelity, downstream utility and privacy
* Leveraging synthetic data for augmentation use cases

## Workshop Materials
This repository contains the RMarkdown tutorials and exemplar datasets used during the session. The two exemplar datasets are publicly available and already de-identified. The privacy use case is for demonstration purposes: 

* COVID-19: available at https://www.covid19survivalcalculator.com/en/download
* Breast Cancer: available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/451/breast+cancer+coimbra

Slides, pre-readings, and other session materials are shared with participants via the AI4PH Summer Institute event webpage.
